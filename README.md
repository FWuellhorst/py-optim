py-optim
========

A collection of (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms with a unified interface.

Objective
---------
Provide a very flexible framework to experiment with algorithm design for optimization problems that rely on (stochastic) gradients. 
Issues considered:

* minibatches
* learning rates, fixed, adaptive, annealing
* preconditioning
* momentum
* averaging
* ...


Dependencies
------------
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
* [PyBrain](htttp://www.pybrain.org)
